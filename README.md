📌 Problem Statement

The given dataset is in a wide format, where multiple Date and Salesperson columns are repeated for each Brand and Model. This structure makes the data difficult to analyze, filter, and use for reporting purposes.

Because sales information is spread across several columns, it is not suitable for:

Creating pivot tables

Performing time-based analysis

Using the data in Power BI or databases

Therefore, the problem is to transform the wide-format dataset into a normalized (long-format) table where each row represents a single sales transaction with clearly defined columns such as Brand, Model, Date, and Salesperson.

This transformation improves data consistency, readability, and usability for analysis and decision-making.
